<html><body>Pythagoras Theorem - <h2>Detailed Explanation Introduction</h2> The Pythagoras Theorem is one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, especially in geometry. It establishes a relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, this theorem helps us calculate the length of one side of a triangle when the other two are known. <h2>Statement of the Theorem</h2> In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. <h2>Mathematical Expression</h2> If a. b are the lengths of the two legs of a right-angled triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then: c² = a² + b² <h2>Example</h2> Let one side of a right triangle be 3 units and the other side be 4 units. <h2>To find the hypotenuse</h2> c² = 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 c = √25 = 5 units Therefore, the hypotenuse is 5 units. <h2>Applications</h2> To calculate distances between two points in geometry and coordinate systems. In construction and architecture to ensure right angles. In navigation and map design to determine shortest paths. In physics to calculate resultant forces and velocities. Part of c² = a² + b² Part of c² = a² + b² c² = a² + b² <h2>Conclusion</h2> The Pythagoras Theorem is a cornerstone of geometry, forming the basis of trigonometry. real-world problem solving. It demonstrates how mathematical relationships describe spatial structures accurately and elegantly.</p><p>
